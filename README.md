This project was based on a final project where I used equations for the value/price of European Options based on the Options, Futures, and derivatives by Hull and the Primer for Financial Engineering by Dan Stefanica.

# Derivation
Using the stock process typically defined, we start with:

$$dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dz$$

where we have the $\mu S$ defined as the drift rate since we take S as the price and the parameter $\mu$ as the expected rate of return on a stock. We can easily see that without the uncertainty and variation term $\mu S dt$ we would get $S_T = S_0\exp{\mu T}$
